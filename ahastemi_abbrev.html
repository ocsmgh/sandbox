ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina and Non–ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Executive Summary and Recommendations
A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Committee on the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina)

Class I: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a given procedure or treatment is useful and effective.
Class II: Conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of a procedure or treatment.
Class IIa: Weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy.
Class IIb: Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion.
Class III: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that the procedure/treatment is not useful/effective and in some cases may be harmful.

A. Clinical Assessment

1. Patients with symptoms that suggest possible ACS should not be evaluated solely over the telephone but should be referred to a facility that allows evaluation by a physician and the recording of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Class I, Level of Evidence: C

2. Patients with a suspected ACS with chest discomfort at rest for >20 minutes, hemodynamic instability, or recent syncope or presyncope should be strongly considered for immediate referral to an emergency department (ED) or a specialized chest pain unit. Other patients with a suspected ACS may be seen initially in an ED, a chest pain unit, or an outpatient facility. Class I, Level of Evidence: C

B. Early Risk Stratification


1. A determination of the likelihood (high, intermediate, or low) of acute ischemia caused by CAD should be made in all patients with chest discomfort. Class I, Level of Evidence: C

2. Patients who present with chest discomfort should undergo early risk stratification that focuses on anginal symptoms, physical findings, ECG findings, and biomarkers of cardiac injury. Class I, Level of Evidence: B

3. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained immediately (within 10 minutes) in patients with ongoing chest discomfort and as rapidly as possible in patients who have a history of chest discomfort consistent with ACS but whose discomfort has resolved by the time of evaluation. Class I, Level of Evidence: C

4. Biomarkers of cardiac injury should be measured in all patients who present with chest discomfort consistent with ACS. A cardiac-specific troponin is the preferred marker, and if available, it should be measured in all patients. CK-MB by mass assay is also acceptable. In patients with negative cardiac markers within 6 hours of the onset of pain, another sample should be drawn in the 6- to 12-hour time frame (eg, at 9 hours after the onset of symptoms). Class I, Level of Evidence: C

1. For patients who present within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, an early marker of cardiac injury (eg, myoglobin or CK-MB subforms) should be considered in addition to a cardiac troponin. Class IIa, Level of Evidence: C

1. C-reactive protein(CRP) and other markers of inflammation should be measured. Class IIb, Level of Evidence: B

1. Total CK (without MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT),β-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, and/or lactate dehydrogenase should be the marker for the detection of myocardial injury in patients with chest discomfort suggestive of ACS. Class III, Level of Evidence: C
